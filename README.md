## HAT RACK - Mix & Match 3 HATs or 6 pHATs with Raspberry Pi

![HAT RACK](/img/hat-rack.png)

HAT RACK is the big brother to our [DINPi board](https://github.com/plasmadancom/DINPi), and is compatible! Stack, wire or daisy chain together to create arrays of connected HATs or pHATs. Ideal for home automation or industrial control applications. HAT RACK is also DIN rail mountable using three universal rail adaptors.

Just like its little brother, HAT RACK allows a Raspberry Pi to be mounted upside down. No need for ribbon cables or messy wiring, just plug & play! Available as a kit, simply solder whichever headers / sockets you require for your project. Or buy an assembled unit with all the parts pre-installed [here](https://plasmadan.com/hatrack).

HAT RACK can be used in a number of ways depending on your requirements. The board-to-board connector can also double as a secondary Raspberry Pi position, allowing a full 3 HATs to be mounted on a single HAT RACK board.

You can also power your HATs and back-power your Raspberry Pi by means of a 3.5mm pitch terminal block.
