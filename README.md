# You Can Never Have Too Many HATs!

![HAT RACK](/img/hat-rack.gif)

HAT RACK is the big brother to our [DINPi board](https://github.com/plasmadancom/DINPi), and is backwards compatible! HAT RACK allows multiple Raspberry Pi HATs / pHATs to be connected to a single Raspberry Pi. Ideal for home automation, IoT, or industrial control applications. The plug & play design allows you to create tidy, professional looking setups easily!

## Features
* Connect 3 HATs or 6 pHATs
* Plug & Play Raspberry Pi or Pi Zero
* Daisy chain multiple boards
* DIN rail mountable
* Optional external power in
* Clear & descriptive BCM pin numbering

A single Raspberry Pi can be mounted upside down. No need for ribbon cables, just plug & play! Available as a kit, simply solder whichever headers / sockets you require for your project. Or buy an assembled unit with all the parts pre-installed [here](https://plasmadan.com/hatrack).

## Incredibly Versatile

HAT RACK can be configured in a whole bunch of ways. In theory there's no limit to how many boards you can have, provided you can supply enough power to them.

## External Powering

You can optionally externally power your boards. This may be necessary when using lots of HATs or pHATs as the Raspberry Pi may not be able to supply enough power to them. This will depend on the HATs being used. Low-power HATs (such as our [CTRL HAT](https://plasmadan.com/ctrlhat)) can be daisy chained several times before external powering becomes necessary.
